                This website is my final project for CS 5630 at the University
                of<br />
                Utah. It is a tool to explore the effectiveness and popularity
                of<br />
                chess openings. Data is pulled from lichess.com's public
                database of<br />
                online chess games. One can filter the games loaded into the<br />
                visualization by skill level. This visualization is intended
                to<br />
                answer questions about the relationship between player skill
                level,<br />
                move popularity, and move effectiveness. For more detail about
                the<br />
                project, see the attached <a href="process_book.pdf">Process Book</a>!<br /><br />
